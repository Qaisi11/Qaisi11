Hello, my name is Ibrahim Qaisi I'm in grade 9, and I'm currently working on becoming the best person I could possibly be. I'm currently learning more about computer science and what we do in class. I'm looking to collaborate on coding and making things work with my partners. You can reach me by contacting me on my email iqaisi.26@acsamman.edu.jo. In addition, I don't go by any pronouns. And a fun fact about me is that I love playing football and one day I want to become a professional footballer. Thank you!
