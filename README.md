> Hello, my name is Ibrahim Qaisi I'm in grade 9, and im from :jordan: :palestinian_territories: and America and I'm currently working on becoming the best person I could possibly be. I'm also trying to learn more about computer science and what we do in class. I'm looking to collaborate on coding and making things work with my partners. You can reach me by contacting me on my email iqaisi.26@acsamman.edu.jo. In addition, I don't go by any pronouns. And a fun fact about me is that I love playing :soccer: and one day I want to become a professional footballer. The table above shows how I see my stats in football and if I had a card how much I would sell it for.

Thanks for checking out my repositroy! :kissing_heart:
